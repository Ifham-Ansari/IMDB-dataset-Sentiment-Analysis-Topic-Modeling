# Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling on IMDB 50k Reviews

## Overview

This repository contains multiple projects focused on sentiment analysis and topic modeling using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The IMDB 50k reviews dataset is utilized to explore, preprocess, analyze, and derive meaningful insights about movie reviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

1. **`sentiment_ML.ipynb`**  
   - **Description:**  
     Performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB 50k reviews dataset using:  
       - Naive Bayes (NB)  
       - Logistic Regression (LR)  
     - **Key Features:**  
       - Comparison of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for both models.  
       - Insights into model performance for classification tasks.  

2. **`sentiment_classification_DL.ipynb`**  
   - **Description:**  
     Applies deep learning to sentiment classification using:  
       - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.  
     - **Key Features:**  
       - Implementation of LSTM for textual data.  
       - Analysis of its performance metrics.  

3. **`Topic_Modeling_BERT.ipynb`**  
   - **Description:**  
     Performs topic modeling on the IMDB 50k reviews dataset using BERTopic.  
     - **Key Features:**  
       - Topic extraction to discover themes in reviews.  
       - Insights into common discussion points such as acting, screenplay, and music.  

4. **`index.ipynb`**  
   - **Description:**  
     A comprehensive file combining all the analyses and comparisons in one place.  
     - **Key Features:**  
       - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
         - Visualizations of demographic and textual data.  
         - Identification of the best and worst-reviewed movies by genre.  
       - Sentiment Analysis Comparison:  
         - Metrics comparison for Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and LSTM models.  
       - Topic Modeling with BERTopic:  
         - Extracting and visualizing key topics in the reviews.  
       - Preprocessed data and model training insights.
